# Snippets

Useful command-line snippets to do stuff I don't want to do more than once.

## Getting started
Add `<wherever-you-cloned-this-to>/bin` to your `PATH`.

## Library

* `snadd <snippet-name>` creates a new Ruby shell script in ./bin, makes it executable and opens it in Sublime Text.
* `rubyapp <app-name>` creates a new directory containing a Ruby app with RSpec.
* `sinatrapp <AppName>` creates a new directory containing a Sinatra app with Capybara and RSpec. _Note that you should use the constantized version of `AppName` with this one._
